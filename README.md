# Welcome !

This is just a fun porject to learn a little bit more what is the <a href="https://clack.cc">@clackjs</a> library for making fun command lines tools that 
can help us developers automate some of the tasks that are annoying and time effecient (i.e setup a new project, installing/updating dependencies, git commits...)

You can clone it and test it yourself, here are the steps :

1. Clone the project
```git clone https://github.com/CyrilPerrinjaquet/cli-quiz.git```

2. Start the project
```node index.js```

 Then you can modify som equestions as you like!

 Have fun coding!
